The real estate industry has expanded in recent years, providing many benefits. With extensive advertising on social media, electronic platforms bombard people with things to purchase by the number of bedrooms and availability of different amenities. Real estate is one of the most critical assets in today's world, especially in a city with potential job hubs that attract a lot of individuals. The primary goal of this project is to estimate the housing market's current price. While doing so, considerations like the number of bedrooms and the availability of other amenities are made. This prediction is meant to assist a customer in finding more practical solutions and better meet their needs. We employed a linear regression model to estimate the cost of the various houses in question. This technique saves the customer from having to speak with a broker, which is another benefit.
